ë(¤role©assistant§contentÚ Based on the search results, it appears that China is currently experiencing a slowdown in new infections and has reported 427 new cases over the past 24 hours, but the global situation is becoming increasingly severe. The article from NBC 7 states that "the virus outbreak goes global as economies hit hard" (NBC 7).

However, another article notes that the US, including online retail giant Amazon, has taken measures to postpone non-essential travel, indicating that the outbreak is not limited to China.

A more alarming assessment comes from Foreign Affairs, which states that the United States' ability to mount an effective response to future outbreaks has not improved despite its experience with COVID-19, suggesting that the country may be ill-prepared for the next outbreak. (Foreign Affairs)

According to these sources, it's difficult to pinpoint a specific country as having the highest levels of outbreak currently, but China appears to have reported fewer new cases recently compared to the United States.
