Okay, the user asked "Hey how are you ?" I need to respond in a friendly and helpful manner. Let me start by acknowledging their greeting.

Since today is February 7th, 2026, I should mention the current date to keep things up-to-date. Maybe add something about the weather or events happening around that time, but since I don't have real-time data, I'll stick to a general response.

I should also invite them to ask for help if they need anything. Keep it conversational and positive. Let me put that all together in a natural way.
