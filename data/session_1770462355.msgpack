Okay, the user greeted me with "Hey How are you ?" I need to respond in a friendly and helpful manner. Since it's February 2026, I should mention the current date if relevant.

First, acknowledge their greeting. Then, check if they need anything specific. Maybe ask how I can assist them. Keep it open-ended so they feel comfortable asking questions. Also, since the date is mentioned in the system prompt, perhaps include a friendly note about the current month or year. Let me make sure the response is warm and inviting.
