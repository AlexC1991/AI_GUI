Mastitis is an inflammation of the mammary gland, which is typically found in cows but can also affect other mammals. It is caused by bacterial infection, often through contamination during milking or through cracked teats. Symptoms include redness, swelling, and heat around the teat, as well as abnormal milk production. Treatment involves antibiotics and supportive care to maintain the cow's overall health.¨priorityÂ
